# Word Wizard
Word Wizard is a word guessing game you can play in your terminal.

## Installation
You can install and run with NPM. Simply open your terminal and type the following commands:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mattoattacko/word-wizard
$ cd word-wizard
$ npm install
```
Then, start the game with:
```
$ node index.js
```
Alternatively, to install system-wide (so that you don't have to be in the directory to run the app), just run:
```
$ npm link
```
This will make the command `word-guess-cli` available to you anywhere in your terminal! No need `cd` into this git repo to run the app.
